irongpm-rules-evaluation-scenario
============

This project is a template for an example rule loader for the [IronGPM Project][irongpm] clients.
It provides an example implementation to build a .jar which can be used in the `rules` folder of the main project.

It only consists of the examplary hard-coded rule implementation within the loadRules() method.
See the in-code comments for some ideas.

This template was created by the [Trust@HsH research group][trustathsh]
at the [Hochschule Hannover][hshannover] (University of Applied Sciences and Arts,
Hannover, Germany).
